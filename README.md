# Selective Attention and Convolution: A Novel Approach to Sequence-Based Text Classification

## Abstract
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing with applications in search engines, recommendation systems, and e-commerce. However, traditional models like Naive Bayes and KNN are computationally expensive and lack the ability to handle complex textual features effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Selective Attention mechanisms to improve classification performance and efficiency. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the impact of each component. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods and deep learning baselines across multiple datasets.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
- Text classification is crucial for organizing, searching, and retrieving information, especially in e-commerce and search engines.
- Challenges include handling large-scale text data, capturing complex linguistic features, and balancing computational efficiency with accuracy.

### 1.2 Limitations of Existing Methods
- **Naive Bayes**: Simple but suffers from zero-frequency issues and poor performance on long sequences.
- **KNN**: High accuracy but computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
- **Autoencoders/DNN**: Require large-scale parameters, leading to inefficiency in sequence data processing.

### 1.3 Contributions
- Propose a hybrid CNN and Selective Attention framework for text classification.
- Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of convolutional and attention mechanisms.
