# Selective Attention and Convolution: A Novel Approach to Sequence-Based Text Classification

## **Abstract**
Text classification plays a vital role in various applications such as e-commerce, search engines, and content categorization. This study proposes a novel hybrid framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Self-Attention mechanisms to address the challenges of sequence data classification. Through extensive ablation studies and comparisons with traditional models, the proposed architecture demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy in handling text-based tasks.
